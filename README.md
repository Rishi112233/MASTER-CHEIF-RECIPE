~ Allow it to cool in a bowl, mix the cheese, herbs and a little salt if required.

~ With the help of a knife,slit open the potatoes in the centre,keeping the base of the potatoes intact and stuff them 
  with the prepared cheese mixture.

~ Grill the potatoes in a hot oven at 200C/400F until the cheese melts and is a little browned.
